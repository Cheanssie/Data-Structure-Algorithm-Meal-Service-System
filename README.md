## Abstract Data Types Utilization
### ArrayList: 
The ArrayList ADT is employed to efficiently store and manage dynamic lists of meal items. This data structure allows for easy insertion, deletion, and retrieval of meal data, providing a flexible and scalable solution for handling the menu.

### Circular Queue: 
The Circular Queue ADT is used to implement a systematic and efficient queue system for meal orders. With this data structure, meal orders are managed in a circular manner, ensuring smooth processing and preventing data overflow.

### Double Linked Set: 
The Double Linked Set ADT is utilized to maintain a collection of unique elements, such as special dietary preferences or exclusive offers. This data structure facilitates quick access to unique data and ensures that each element appears only once.

### Linked List: 
The Linked List ADT is harnessed to establish a linked sequence of meal ingredients or customer information. Its dynamic nature allows for easy insertion and deletion of elements, enabling smooth management of various aspects of the meal service.
